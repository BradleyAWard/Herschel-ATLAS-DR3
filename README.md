# Herschel - ATLAS Data Release III
The Herschel-ATLAS was the largest open time submillimetre survey carried out using the Herschel Space Observatory, covering 660 square degrees of sky, spanning redshifts out to z~6. Nearly half a million sources were detected in the Herschel maps, with approximately 200,000 sources found in the South Galactic Pole field (~317 square degrees). This repostiory contains the analysis of VIKING near-infrared counterparts to the Herschel sources in the SGP. We provide a data release of ~110,000 reliably matched counterparts to these submillimetre sources, providing an extensive catalogue of dusty, star-forming SMGs for the study of obscured star formation.

### North Galactic Plane and GAMA Fields
![North_cap_areas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60989190/141457714-c53ec16b-e0f0-437a-842c-460b6e134875.png)

#### NGP: 
Rectangular field measuring 15 degrees by 10 degrees, centred on R.A. = 199.5, decl. = 29, and rotated clockwise by 8 degrees. The red circle within the NGP shows the location of the Coma cluster.

#### GAMA:
Three GAMA fields located at R.A. of 9hrs, 12hrs and 14hrs, each covering approximately 12 degrees in R.A. and 3 degrees in decl, designed to overlap with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The dark blue line represents the area covered by the 2dF survey, the light blue line represents coverage from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and the yellow line represents the coverage from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

#### SGP:
Split into two adjacent blocks, the South Galactic Plane region measures approximately 300 square degrees and has coverage from the 2dF (dark blue), KiDS (light blue) and the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) surveys. The magenta line represents the coverage from the Dark Energy Survey (DES).
